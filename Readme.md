# Sketch Text Styles to CSS

This plugin generates an overview of all your text styles and exports it as CSS.

Shortcut: `ctrl` + `⌥` + `⌘` + `T`

Note: Does not work in Sketch Beta 3.2

Sketch will then ask you for a export location. After you selected one, you also need to authorize Sketch to write to that location.

Bonus feature: You can also make use of "rem" by entering a base font size. That way, font sizes can be specified in `rem` if you like. To do so, you need to change the setting from `false` to `true`:

`com.getflourish.css.formatOptions.useRelativeFontSize = true;`

# Sketch Text Styles to CSS

This plugin displays all text styles of the current Sketch document in a floating panel and exports all styles to a CSS file.

Shortcut: `ctrl` + `⌥` + `⌘` + `T`

Note: Does not work in Sketch Beta 3.2

To use this plugin, you need to once authorize Sketch to write to the folder where your document is saved.

Bonus feature: You can also make use of "rem" by entering a base font size. That way, font sizes can be specified in `rem` if you like. To do so, you need to change the setting from `false` to `true`:

`com.getflourish.css.formatOptions.useRelativeFontSize = true;`

# Sketch Text Styles to CSS

This plugin generates an overview of all your text styles and exports it as CSS.

`ctrl` + `⌥` + `⌘` + `T`

Sketch will also ask you for a base font size. That way, font sizes can be specified in `rem` if you like.
To do so, you need to change the setting from `false` to `true`:

`com.getflourish.css.formatOptions.useRelativeFontSize = true;`
